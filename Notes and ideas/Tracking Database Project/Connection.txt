- I'm using Excel to monitor my team and I would like to run some queries on our tracking database.

Please can I request read-only access to the following database using my AD login:

v12b-sql12app,9433;SaveOurSounds

Does this relate to specific equipment?
- No

I've assigned you to an AD group that has read only access - you may need to login again to pick up the revised permissions.
